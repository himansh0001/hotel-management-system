# Hotel Management System in C++

## Overview

The **Hotel Management System** is a C++ console-based application that provides a simple, user-friendly interface for hotel staff to efficiently perform key tasks such as room booking, customer information management, room allocation, editing customer details, and handling restaurant orders. The project aims to streamline the daily operations of a hotel, ensuring smooth business functionality and enhanced customer service delivery.

## Features

### 1. Room Booking
- Staff can easily book rooms by entering customer details such as name, address, phone number, and the duration of stay.
- Rooms are categorized into:
  - **Deluxe**
  - **Executive**
  - **Presidential**
- The system offers different pricing options based on room categories, making it easier to allocate rooms based on customer preferences and budget.

### 2. Customer Information Management
- The system maintains a database of customer details, allowing quick retrieval and display of information. 
- This feature is helpful for managing booking inquiries and tracking customer data.

### 3. Room Allocation Overview
- A comprehensive overview of all allocated rooms is displayed in a tabular format.
- The table includes details like room number, guest name, address, room type, and contact number.

### 4. Editing Customer Details
- Hotel staff can modify customer information such as name, address, phone number, and duration of stay.
- This ensures data consistency and accuracy by updating the relevant records in the database.

### 5. Restaurant Service Management
- Customers can place orders for meals (breakfast, lunch, or dinner) from their rooms.
- The charges are automatically added to the customerâ€™s bill, improving convenience for customers and ensuring seamless service.

### 6. User-Friendly Console Interface
- The system operates on a console-based interface using standard input/output, making it lightweight and easily adaptable to different platforms without needing complex graphical interfaces.

## Requirements

To compile and run the **Hotel Management System**, ensure the following components are properly configured in your environment:

1. **C++ Compiler**  
   The project requires a C++ compiler such as **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)**, which is widely supported on operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS.
   
2. **Standard C++ Libraries**  
   The program uses the following standard libraries:
   - `iostream` for input/output operations
   - `fstream` for file handling
   - `stdio.h` and `string.h` for C-style input/output and string operations
   - `iomanip` for formatting output
